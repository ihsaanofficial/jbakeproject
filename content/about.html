                    <h2>Why we built ipgeolocation.io?</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the past couple of years, weâ€™ve been building applications which were highly dependent on the geographic area of the end users. The <a href="https://ipgeolocation.io/blog/ip-geolocation-backstory-20180520214720">problems we faced</a> in our journey led us to create our own IP Geolocation Service.
